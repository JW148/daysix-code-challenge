      "To keep this advantage, continue your current activities and consider adding variety. For example, if you walk, try routes with hills. If you do strength exercises, ensure you're including movements that challenge your legs in different ways (like lunges or step-ups safely). This helps keep your muscles adaptable and strong.",
      "Challenge your excellent balance further. Try activities like Tai Chi, yoga, or even simple exercises like standing on one leg for 15-30 seconds while brushing your teeth (ensure you have support nearby if needed). This enhances your stability, further protecting against falls.",

    tips: [
      "Incorporate more 'sit-to-stands' into your daily routine. For example, each time you sit down or stand up from a chair at home or work, do it mindfully, perhaps a couple of extra times. Try to use your leg muscles more and rely less on your arms. This directly strengthens the muscles used in the test.",
      "Add two 10-minute 'strength snacks' to your week. This could be as simple as doing 2-3 sets of 8-12 bodyweight squats (focus on good form, going as low as comfortable) or calf raises. Small, regular efforts make a big difference in maintaining and improving the strength this test measures.",

      "You've taken a positive step by doing the test! While your score is currently below average, this is valuable information. Let's look at ways to gradually build your strength and balance",
    tips: [
      "Start by practicing the sit-to-stand motion safely. Sit towards the front of a sturdy chair, feet flat. If needed, use the armrests to help you push up to a full stand, and then control your movement back down. Aim for 5-8 repetitions, 1-2 times a day. Focus on quality over quantity. As you get stronger, try to use your arms less.",
      "Incorporate simple leg-strengthening exercises. While seated, you can do leg extensions (straighten one knee, hold for a few seconds, then lower slowly). Or, try heel raises and toe raises while seated or standing (holding onto a counter for support). Aim for 10-15 repetitions of each, a few times a week. These build the foundational strength needed for better sit-stand performance and easier daily movement",
      "If comfortable and safe for you, try to add short walks to your day, even 5-10 minutes. Walking helps build overall leg endurance and strength. Start slow and gradually increase your time or distance as you feel able. Every step helps!",

      "Thanks for completing the test! You've taken the first step in understanding your current strength level. This gives you a solid starting point — and every bit of progress begins with that first step!",
    tips: [
      "Build consistency through everyday movement. Small daily habits add up. Try to include intentional movements in your routine — like standing up and sitting down slowly from a chair a few extra times, or taking short walking breaks if you’ve been sitting for long periods. These simple changes help build strength and mobility over time.",
      "Start with manageable strength-building exercises. Add two short sessions to your week, just 10 minutes each. Focus on bodyweight movements such as squats, calf raises, or stepping up and down from a low step. Keep the focus on good form and controlled movement. As these feel easier, you can gradually increase intensity.",
